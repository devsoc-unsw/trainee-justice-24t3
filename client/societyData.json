Whether someone is an international Filipino student missing home, a local Filo wanting to get in touch with their roots, or just someone looking for a fun time, everyone can be a part of the FiloSoc kapamilya. The club sees the unique background of all its members worthy of celebration. True to Filipino culture, many of our events are centred on food and forming friendships from night markets to boodle fights, karaoke nights, or simple kapihan (coffee) sessions!",

It has become one of the most successful manga and TV series in the world, having broken the internet on multiple occasions and holds a key place in pop culture today. The series has broken the Guinness World record for most printed comic series by one author in 2015, and has become the 3rd highest-selling book series, behind Harry Potter and Superman. This society will be devoted to appreciating the great world-building, story, characters and pure excitement of the series, which withstands the test of time. What distinguishes us from broader societies such as AUNSW, is our specialised focus of interest in One Piece as a series, and our intentions to facilitate One Piece themed and influenced events. Furthermore, we hope to engage with members on a sentimental level, by advocating and instilling profound values and wisdom, deep-rooted in the series. Weekly read-alongs/watch-alongs, movie nights, theory-crafting and discussion calls, art sessions and get-togethers are all events very unique to the One Piece series and engage with all members, on an interpersonal level.",
